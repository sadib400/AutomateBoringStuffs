### What is this repository for? 😶
Sometimes we need to do a lot things which are repetitive. Then we  programmers write scripts to help us with. I love to write and collect these scripts. This repository is for this purpose. 

### How is this helpful for me? 🤔	
Frankly, I do not know 🤗. Maybe you may run into similar situations,then you may find your desired script here. Of course, I am building this repo SEO in mind. So maybe you are here because of that! 😇

### How is this organised? 👶
This is organised into folders. Every folder name indicates what is it for. There you will find details how you can use.
